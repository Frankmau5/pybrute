Welcome to py-brute
This program is used to learn how to make a tkinter gui
as well as a brute force passwords.
You can use this if you have forgotten your password for
a zip file also.

Brute force can be a very slow process (days, even weeks or more )
This program does not use all your cpu cores so it will be
slower then other Brute force programs but there are some tip to help speed this up.

Tips to speed up the brute focre process:
if you know the length of the password this will help alot.
